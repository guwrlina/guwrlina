- 👋 Hi, I’m @guwrlina
- 👀 I’m interested in AI/ML and mobile app development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning flutter and deep learning with python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone who's interest aligned to mine
- 📫 You can reach me through my email: pangerlyn21@gmail.com or feel free to visit and explore my projects here
- 😄 Pronouns: Shey? haha can't tell eh! guess it?
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can make my ears move. I love spending time alone observing people's activity in public places, I just find amusing how different and similar they are in various ways. Another thing, am deeply invested in AI/ML as I always jokes around about how I struggle with it but still dealing it until discover the logic of an error hahahuhuhu. Am also a very introverted person, I feel more energized and fully functional alone than when I am sorrounded with people.
